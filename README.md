# ConsoleTriviaGame-MVC
A C# Console project for a trivia game, using Azure CosmosDB for a database and an MVC pattern.

In the actual project, a fully functional Microsoft Azure account and database was setup and used. In order to protect the access keys however, they have been replaced with the generic access keys to the emulator.


In order to run the project, the CosmosDB emulator must be installed and started. The project will handle the rest.
